# Plotagon Frontend Work Sample


We want you to make a duplicate of this project and share the new repo with one of our developers - this is so that your work sample stays private. We don't want anybody else to see how you've solved this do we?
For us to be able to evaluate your work, make sure the project runs properly when we run ```npm install && grunt ``` The code will only be run in lates public build of Chrome, so no polyfills to support IE6.

## What we want you to do

We want you to create an app to navigate and view the Staff Picked movies from plotagon.com.

The most important part is how structured your code is, but extra love is given for coolness and general niceness. We want to see how you will handle an external API, how your code is structured into files and directories and how external libraries are included (if needed).

The movie data can be found here:

We do not want you to spend too much time on this, but at the same time you are welcome to contribute with improvement on your own. Pretty design? Responsive design? Innovative UX? Fancy build pipeline? Distribution build target? Just show off you talent!
